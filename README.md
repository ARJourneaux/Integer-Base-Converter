CLI script that converts integers in one base to another. Can handle negative integers and bases. Bases can range from -62 to 62.

Integers can use characters 0-9, a-z, A-Z. a=10 and A=36. Bases are in decimal form. Negative inputs are prefixed with '-' and multiple inputs are seperated by a comma.

Adding a file name as a console arg will use that file as input. File layout must be a single base, integers seperated by commas and conversion bases seperated by commas; all on newlines.
Adding "output" as a console arg after a file name will output to a text file name "output.txt"

Codewars experiment that went too far.
